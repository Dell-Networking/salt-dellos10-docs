This information explains the usage of SaltStack (Salt) for deploying the configuration into Dell EMC Networking OS10 switches.

Salt
****

Salt is a configuration management system, capable of maintaining remote nodes in defined states (for example, ensuring that a specific configuration is maintained in the switch).

Salt and NAPALM together represent a vendor-agnostic way of a configuration management system (see `more information about saltstack <https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics>`_).

Dell EMC Networking OS10 switches can be managed and automated using Salt in a vendor-neutral way using the napalm-proxy.
